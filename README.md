# Infinity radar

Every 5 seconds a new chunk is charted. Starting from the center, the radar spirals outwards until an uncharted chunk is encountered. After a cooldown of 5 secons the next chunk is charted. This process goes on until infinity has been reached.

-   Add compatibility with mods that delete empty chunks
